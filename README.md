ALTER DATABASE {database name} OWNER TO {user name};
```

### **Environment variables:**
Environment variables are one of the ways we keep our product safe. If you want to access our app locally you will need to add your own.
- create .env file
- add your Environment variables
```sh
DB_URL= # Your development PostgreSQL connect
NODE_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY= # Your Secret key
```
